My new video-art project. Images and music inspired from the Ancient Mysteries. The idea was based on creating a generally, symmetrical pattern, where beginning and end would coincide. So every time a cycle ends, a completely new one begins, which is always determined by the observer/listener's point of focus, both visually and auditory. Thus each work in the mirrors of the Mysteries is created with the idea of moving perpetually through time, exactly like the idea of ancient Mysteries that will never cease to exist and move the human imagination. Possible symbolisms that may be presented are completely random and have absolutely nothing to do with the essence that the art-work hopes to address: To act like a magic mirror, revealing to everyone the entrance to the world of fantasy.

All videos and musical compositions are created by Achilles Nasios in 2022.
