The visible world seems to be comprised of endless archetypal images. Although those images are not necessarily carriers of meaning   
they possess the quality to transfer the spectator closer and deeper in the world of the unconscious.  
Forms get released from the obvious of denotation and begin to act exclusively as connotations. Meaning is acquired according to the  
importance that things are given.  
The Indigo archetypes unit doesn't aspire to describe objects and their condition. The images in this unit do not always demand   
interpretation; they only expect permission to become a source of inspiration.
