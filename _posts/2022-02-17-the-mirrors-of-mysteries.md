Video-art project. Images and music inspired from the Ancient Mysteries. 

After many years of studying the symmetry and it's properties, I finally decided to make use of it. I used light and shadow, considering both as indelible elements that could depict the myth both symbolically and actually. When I finally discovered the work method to get the desired results, I began an intensive work of synthesis. I started composing music and synchronizing it with image.  
The idea was based on creating a generally, symmetrical pattern, where beginning and end would coincide. So every time a cycle ends, a completely new one begins, which is always determined by the observer/listener's point of focus, both visually and auditory. Thus each work in the mirrors of the Mysteries is created with the idea of moving perpetually through time, exactly like the idea of ancient Mysteries that will never cease to exist and move the human imagination. Possible symbolisms that may be presented are completely random and have absolutely nothing to do with the essence that the art-work hopes to address: To act like a magic mirror, revealing to everyone the entrance to the world of fantasy. 

All videos and musical compositions are created by Achilles Nasios in 2022. You can also find as NFTs on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-mirrors-of-mysteries" target="blank"> **open sea.io**</a>

  In the 19th century archaeologists exploring the ancient ruins of Nineveh discovered 22,000 clay tablets which are directly connected to the Anunnaki. The ancient Sumerians claim that they obtained their knowledge of past events from the teachings and writings of the Anunnaki (“Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came”). According to the Ancient Alien theory, the Anunnaki genetically altered primitive mankind and created a labor force which allowed them to mine gold faster.

  The soul of man -often called Psyche, and in the Eleusinian Mysteries symbolized by Persephone- is essentially a spiritual thing. Its true home is in the higher worlds, where, free from the bondage of material form and material concepts, it is said to be truly alive and self-expressive. The human, or physical, nature of man, according to this doctrine, is a tomb, a quagmire, a false and impermanent thing, the source of all sorrow and suffering. Plato describes the body as the sepulcher of the soul; and by this he means not only the human form but also the human nature.
