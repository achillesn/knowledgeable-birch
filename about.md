Achilles Nasios is an Art-Photographer and video-artist. He was born and rased in Greece.

**Studies:**

1986-1991 – Fine Art School in Berlin (HDK). Diplom in Visual Communication and Curating.

2003-2005 - Fine Art School in Athens (ASFA). Master in Digital Arts.

2009-2010 - Royal Fine Art School in Stockholm (KKH). Master in Video Art.

From 1995-2007 I taught theory and applied Art Photography in the University of Western Attica, in the University of Ioannina and in the Photography Team of the cultural Center of Peania.

After 2007 I moved to Sweden where I continued teaching through the net and organizing workshops, participating in exhibitions but also curating them up to now.

From 2015 onwards I started developing a new pedagogic method of approaching photography based on games. Until this very day several types of photo games have been played successfully.

In 2019 I co-found the Network of Arts and Sciences HocusPhotus.
